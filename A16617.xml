            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Howſoeuer it greiueth mee to heare of much more to ſe the troubles wherewith Sathan (knowinge his time to be ſhort) doth trouble the Church of God in all places about vnprofitable and Popiſh Cerimonies, yet (to tell you the whole troth) my greife is the leſſe when I conſider that both they them ſelues, who be moſt troubleſome, and do moſt vrge thoſe Reliques of Rome be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,<note place="margin">Rom. 16, 17, 18 Phil: 3:2, 19: Gal. 6.12.</note> or Dumme Dogges or, non Reſident, ſeruing their bellies, and minding Earthly thinges, euen like their Predeceſſors, who vr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged the Cerimonies of Mozes in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churches, and their proceedinges (like them ſelues) be ſo exorbitant that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but proue odious to all men. VVhat a-matter is this, that after the Sacramentall Bread is miniſtred, the Cup ſhould be denied becauſe of not kneeling? If any of theis ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Miniſters had played ſuch apart, thoughe it were with one, <hi>openly knowne to liue in ſinne notorious without repentance, whom by the</hi> 26. <hi>canon no Miniſter ſhall in any wiſe admit to the receiuing of the holy Communion,</hi> how would that Preciſian be trounced But in this Puritan Gouernement of the Church
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15963:2"/> there is no fault but <hi>non conſormitie</hi> to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious vanities, A Bird of theit fether may Preach ſcores of Popiſh Doctrines, be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous in life, and at his laſt caſt at dice when he hath loſt all, ſay, <hi>In the Spite of God let him do now what he can,</hi> and yet hould his owne well inough, An other mans owne and ill inough I mighte well ſay if the law might haue due courſe well, God amend all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the remnant of this Rage. In meane while I reioice to heare that it is giuen to any of Gods people not only to beleiue in Chriſt but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake, hauing the ſame fight which they ſee or heare to be in their Miniſters,<note place="margin">Phil, 1, 27:</note> as it becommeth the Ghoſpel of Chriſt, the ſincerity wherof belongeth as well to the people as to the Miniſters of Chriſt. for howſoeuer all are not to weare the whore of Babilons Smocke, yet all are to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſience of bowing the knee to Baal.

               <hi>KNEELING IN THE VERY</hi> acte of taking, eating and drinking the <hi>Sacramentall bread and wine, in the holy</hi> Communion cannot be without ſinne.</head>
            <p>IT is to be vnderſtood, that, howſoeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Kneeling may (in it ſelfe conſidered) be eſteemed a naturall geſture of the body, as <hi>ſtanding, ſitting,</hi> etc. yet in this caſe, it is by Inſtitution of man.

But if the moſt ſoleme ſigne of reuerence (vſed in theis partes of the world) be with out all reſpecte of reuerence, and that by Inſtitution of authority, in ſo high a part of Gods ſeruice may not ſuche Kneeling be iudged, if not a groſſe mocking of Chriſt, as was the ſouldiours their bowing of knes before him,<note place="margin">Math 27.29 Mal. 1.6.7:</note> yet a taking of the name of god in vaine.

Seeing examples of holy men, much more of Chriſt, are to be followed, except there be ſome reaſonable cauſe to the contrary. And the Apoſtle to reforme an abuſe which crept (even in their times) into loue feaſtes, which were immediatly before, or after the Lords ſupper, did ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them thence, &amp; reduced the manner of adminiſtring the Lords ſupper to the

For if the Apoſtle would not tolerate an indifferent thing (as was a loue feaſt till then) to continue ſo nere the L. ſupper, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was abuſed, how would they allow the chaunge of ſitting into kneeling, eſpecially in theſe two conſiderations?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Firſt, becauſe the abuſe of loue feaſts (viz. <hi>ſuperfluity</hi>) was never ſo great, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dalous, in the Apoſtles time, as the abuſe of <hi>kneeling</hi> (viz. <hi>Idolatry</hi>) was and is in the ſinagogue of Rome: And beſides, Loue feaſtes were either before, or after the L. ſupper, wheras kneeling is in the principal part of the holy Communion. Therfore if the Apoſtle baniſhed Loue feaſtes from the L ſupper, becauſe of the abuſe, &amp; brought the Church to the ſimplicitie of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitution, Is it not a tempting ſinne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15963:5"/> the Idolatrous kneeling of Papiſtes, and reiect the exemplary ſitting of our M. Chriſt?
